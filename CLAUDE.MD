## Project Categories

### Python Projects
- **Machine Learning**: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating supervised learning, classification, and data analysis
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Focus Areas**: Model development, feature engineering, data visualization

### SQL
- **Resources**: Comprehensive reference guides for SQL queries and database operations
- **Coverage**: Query optimization, joins, aggregations, window functions

### Excel & Power BI
- **Resources**: Data cleaning workflows, best practices, and analytical frameworks
- **Tools**: Excel formulas, Power Query, Power BI dashboards

## Development Guidelines

### Working with Jupyter Notebooks
- Notebooks are primarily in the `Python/` directory
- Each notebook should be self-contained with clear markdown documentation
- Include data sources, methodology, and results interpretation
- Ensure reproducibility with proper dependency management

### File Organization
- Keep projects organized by technology/tool in their respective directories
- Use descriptive filenames that indicate project purpose
- Include documentation within project files (markdown cells, comments, README sections)

### Code Quality Standards
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- **SQL**: Use uppercase for keywords, meaningful table/column aliases
- **Notebooks**: Clear markdown explanations, well-commented code, visualizations for insights

### Documentation
- Each project should explain:
  - Purpose and objectives
  - Data sources and preprocessing steps
  - Methodology and approach
  - Key findings and insights
  - Technologies and libraries used

## Working with This Repository

### Adding New Projects
1. Place files in the appropriate directory based on primary technology
2. Use clear, descriptive naming conventions
3. Include inline documentation and comments
4. Update this CLAUDE.MD if adding new categories or significant changes

### Updating Existing Projects
1. Maintain version history through git commits
2. Document significant changes in commit messages
3. Ensure changes don't break notebook execution or references

### Best Practices
- **Notebooks**: Clear cell organization, restart kernel and run all before committing
- **Excel/PowerBI**: Include source data references and transformation notes
- **SQL**: Test queries, include sample outputs or expected results in documentation

## Git Workflow

- Main branch contains stable, portfolio-ready projects
- Feature branches for development work (prefix: `claude/`)
- Commit messages should be descriptive and reference specific changes
- Push completed work to designated feature branches

## Portfolio Presentation

This repository serves as a professional portfolio demonstrating:
- **Technical Skills**: Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, Machine Learning
- **Analytical Thinking**: Problem decomposition, methodology selection
- **Communication**: Clear documentation, visualization, insight presentation
- **Best Practices**: Code quality, reproducibility, version control
